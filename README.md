# Planet Simulator 2014

### What?
Planet Simulator 2014 is part of a small tradition I started a couple years ago on created simulations of our the wonder of astronomy. The "2014" version is something that I've put together in a couple hours based off of my old version. However, expect to see more updates!

### Why? 
This isn't something big that I'm currently making, but just something small that I hope I can hone my coding and visualization skills with. And, hopefully, I can help someone else looking for the same thing.

### How?
Glad you asked! Planet-Simu is easy to use. When the program, first opens, select option 1 or 2 based on what you want to see:

After you make your selection, the actual simulator will open. After that, just right click and drag to pan.

I'm Nagaganesh Jaladanki, a high school student.
