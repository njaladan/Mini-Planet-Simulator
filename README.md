# Mini Planet Simulator


The program was built to analyze the orbits of planets when initialized with only velocity and aphelion. I used the outputted data, which followed a Newtonian orbit, and compared it against NASA data to see how much the planets deviated from this ideal orbit.

The program is pretty self-explanatory, and the outer planets are separated from the inner planets as the numerical methods used to calculate the orbits runs best with different timesteps in each situation.

I initially built this as my final project for an online code-based physics class.
